name: x-content
description: Write X (Twitter) content — a single post or a threaded one, chosen by how much the idea actually carries — each in a short-form framing (hot-take, mini-case, list-thread, before/after) that fits the feed. Use when you need posts that hook fast and keep the concrete specifics intact. Sharpest when connected to Jinn's Brand DNA over MCP.

# X Content

Deliverable: **one X post, or one thread**, built for the format and ready to publish. The choice isn't a preference — it's a read on content density. A single sharp claim ships as one post; an idea with three or more load-bearing beats earns a thread. Don't pad a thin idea into a thread, or cram a rich one into 280 chars.

Works standalone. Connected to Jinn, the post reads in the brand's real voice and keeps its actual claims, not a plausible guess at them.

## Procedure (ungrounded — works with no Jinn connection)

### 1. Fix what you're working with (before writing a word)

Fill this from whatever the user gave you (a URL, a brief, a draft). Blank row → ask one question or take the bracketed default.

| Input | Capture |
|-------|---------|
| The one claim | the single idea the post exists to land |
| Reader | who's scrolling, what they care about — one line |
| Tone (3 adjectives) | e.g. blunt, funny, useful [default: sharp, plain, human] |
| Words to avoid | hype, jargon, off-limits terms [avoid: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "unlock", "🧵 a thread:"] |
| The specifics | numbers, named tools, exact phrases — capture **verbatim**; they're the proof |
| One CTA | the single next step — last post only |

### 2. Decide: single post or thread

Count the load-bearing beats in the claim.

- **1 beat** → **single post.** One idea, ≤280 chars, hook is everything.
- **3+ beats, or a sequence/list/story** → **thread**, under the thread contract:
  - **One idea per post.** No post carries two thoughts; if it does, split it.
  - **The hook post carries the claim.** Post 1 stands alone and makes someone stop — full payoff promised, not "here's what I learned 👇".
  - **The last post carries the CTA.** Earlier posts end on momentum; only the final one asks for the action.

Two beats is a judgment call — default to a single post unless both need room.

### 3. Pick a framing and write it

Pick the one that fits the claim:

- **hot-take** — a sharp opinion stated flat, no hedging. Single post unless it needs a reason.
- **mini-case** — a small real story: situation, move, result. Usually a short thread.
- **list-thread** — N tactics/lessons, one per post, hook post naming the payoff.
- **before/after** — the old way vs the new way; the contrast *is* the content.

Write to X's norms: first seven words do the work, no throat-clearing, line breaks over commas, one CTA total. **Preserve the specifics from step 1 verbatim** — a real number or exact tool name is the difference between a post that lands and one that evaporates. Never soften "cut render time from 40s to 3s" into "much faster."

### 4. Self-check before you hand it over

Run the post (or every post in the thread) through all five — a fail is a rewrite, not a shrug:

- **Banned-phrase scan** — any avoided word or hype phrase? Cut it.
- **Length window** — single post ≤280 chars; each thread post ≤280 and readable alone. Count them.
- **Concrete-specifics scan** — is the real number / named noun still there, unparaphrased? If it got smoothed away, put it back verbatim.
- **Voice plausibility** — read it against the three tone adjectives; rewrite any line that breaks them.
- **Exactly one CTA** — single post: at most one. Thread: exactly one, on the last post.

**Two failed rewrites of a weak thread post → cut it and tighten the thread.** A four-post thread that moves beats a five-post one that drags.

Label the deliverable (single vs thread + framing) and hand it over. That's a real, publishable post.

## If a Jinn MCP connection is present (grounded)

Don't infer the voice — read it. Two calls:

1. `get_token_context` → confirm the token is live and grab a slug from `brand_slugs`. (Fails → see **When a call fails**.)
2. `get_brand_dna_public` with `{ "slug": "<slug>" }` → the bounded projection.

Then replace the guessed inputs with the real ones. Field → decision map:

| Projection field | Drives |
|------------------|--------|
| `tonalAttributes[]` | **The voice.** These adjectives *are* step 1's tone row — write in them verbatim, don't paraphrase. |
| `safeWords[]` | Diction to **reach for** — pre-approved brand language; prefer these in the hook and CTA. |
| `bannedWords[]` | **Hard filter** — feeds the banned-phrase scan. If one appears, rewrite that post. |
| `slangPolicy` | Register rule — how casual short-form may go, whether slang and lowercase are on the table. |
| `formattingConstraints` | Post formatting — emoji, hashtags, casing. Obey literally over the generic norms above. |
| `positioningWedge` | **The claim's edge** — the brand's real angle; sharpens the hot-take and before/after framings. |
| `messagingPillars[]` ({pillar, description}) | **What the post reinforces** — in a thread, different posts carry different pillars so it spans the real narrative. |
| `painPoints` | **Hook fuel** — open the mini-case or before/after on a real pain, not an invented one. |
| `tribes[]` ({name, description, motivation}) | **Who it speaks to** — aim the hook at a named tribe; their `motivation` sets the angle. |

Grounded, the delta is concrete: the hook carries the brand's real `positioningWedge`, the thread spans actual `messagingPillars`, the voice is the exact `tonalAttributes`, claims use `safeWords`, and every post is provably free of `bannedWords`. **State which fields you used** — the wedge, the pillars, the tribe — when you deliver, so the user can see the grounding did work.

Only the fields above exist on a public token. There is no competitor, differentiation, engagement-analytics, or pricing data in the projection — don't reference or request it.

## When a call fails

Read `data.code` on the JSON-RPC error and act:

- **`token_expired`** → request a fresh token: `curl -X POST https://app.jinn.works/api/agents/request-demo-token`, update `JINN_MCP_TOKEN`, retry.
- **`token_malformed`** → your agent likely sent `${JINN_MCP_TOKEN}` literally (Claude Code header bug #51581). Re-add the server with the CLI form:
  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http jinn https://app.jinn.works/api/mcp \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
  ```
- **tool error `not_found`** on `get_brand_dna_public` → that slug isn't in your token's allowlist. Call `get_token_context` and use one of the `brand_slugs` it returns.
- **No token / no connection** → the skill still works generically. Write from the step-1 inputs and note the output is ungrounded; connect Jinn to ground it in a real brand.
